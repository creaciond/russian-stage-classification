# Short Text Classification: a Case of Stage Directions in Russian Drama
This is a repository for BA thesis written in School of Linguistics, NRU HSE (Moscow, RU), throughout the 2018/19 academic year. 

## What is this about?

I already did a project on Russian Drama Corpus and its stage directions â€” it can be found here: [Stage Directions in Russian Drama](https://github.com/creaciond/russian-drama). It dealt more with the quantitative part of the research and exploring corpus trends; at this one, I want to focus on the part which deals more with computational linguistics and machine learning, that is to extract linguistic features and run several different models.

Russian Drama Corpus (or shortly, RusDraCor) can be found at [dracor-org/rusdracor](https://github.com/dracor-org/rusdracor); it is also available in a more user-friendly format at [Dracor website](https://dracor.org/rus).
